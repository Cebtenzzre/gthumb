  In order to build this program you need a working GNOME environment
  version 2 or greater, with the development tools installed properly.  
  The following is the detailed list of libraries you need:

	* glib	 		version >= 2.0.0
	* gtk 			version >= 2.0.0 
	* libxml 		version >= 2.4.0
	* libgnome 		version >= 2.0.0

  If you want to view EXIF data attached to images, you need the libexif 
  library that can be found at this web site : http://libexif.sourceforge.net

  If the libtiff library is present you can save images in TIFF
  format.

  If the libjpeg library is present you have more saving options for
  the JPEG format and the 'rotate jpeg' tool is implemented internally
  otherwise it is implemented calling the external command: jpegtran.
